                "Maratha rulers left behind grandeur and verve that enriches the cultural heritage of the state.  Various cultural affiliations blend together to live harmoniously in the land of prosperity. Maharashtra is divided into small regions and each region is diverse in the form of dialects, folk songs, food, ethnicity. Maharashtra is a melting pot of different races, traditions, and classes. The engaging traditions of Waghya Murali, Potraj, Vasudev, and Gondhali communities have kept alive their unique cultures and vibrant art, adding charm to the cultural vibrancy of the state. Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Zoroastrians (Parsis and Iranians), Christians, and Sikhs live peacefully in the state while the Deccan plateau of Maharashtra is home to tribal communities such as Bhils, Mahadeo, Kolis, Gonds, and Warlis that co-exist peacefully and follow their lifestyles and traditions. 83% of the Maharashtrian are Hindus, however, there has been a prevailing sense of secularism in the state that embraces other religions with great respect and diversity inclusion."
